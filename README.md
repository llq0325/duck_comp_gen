Genome assembly and comparative genomics project with the freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa; stiNae), ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis; oxyJam), African pygmy-goose (Nettapus auritus; netAur), and black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla; hetAtr) from 10x data using Supernova assembly.

Code is being written and optimized, so will change frequently as analyses progress. As of April 29, 2020, CESAR is not yet running properly.

Note: CNEE, CESAR, and 4d models can be run independently on the same dataset, but you will need the GenePred file produced in 4d models before you can run CESAR. All set up for CESAR can happen while you're producing the GenePred file.
